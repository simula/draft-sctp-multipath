      <t>The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) supports multi-homing for
providing network fault tolerance. However, mainly one path is used for data
transmission. Only timer-based retransmissions are carried over other paths
as well.</t>
      <t>This document describes how multiple paths can be used simultaneously for
transmitting user messages.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>One of the important features of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol
(SCTP), which is currently specified in <xref target="RFC4960" format="default"/>, is network
fault tolerance. This feature is for example required for Reliable Server
Pooling (RSerPool, <xref target="RFC5351" format="default"/>). Therefore, transmitting
messages over multiple paths is supported, but only for redundancy. So
<xref target="RFC4960" format="default"/> does not specify how to use multiple paths
simultaneously.</t>
      <t>This document overcomes this limitation by specifying how multiple paths
can be used simultaneously. This has several benefits:
</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>Improved bandwidth usage.</li>
        <li>Better availability check with real user messages compared to
      HEARTBEAT-based information.</li>
      </ul>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

    </section>
    <section anchor="CMT-SCTP" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Load Sharing</name>
      <t>Basic requirement for applying SCTP load sharing is the Concurrent
Multipath Transfer (CMT) extension of SCTP, which utilises multiple
paths simultaneously. We denote CMT-enabled SCTP as CMT-SCTP throughout
this document. CMT-SCTP is introduced in <xref target="IAS06" format="default"/>
and in more detail in <xref target="I06" format="default"/>,
some illustrative examples of chunk handling are provided in
<xref target="OMNeTWorkshop2010-SCTP" format="default"/>.
CMT-SCTP provides three modifications to standard SCTP (split Fast
Retransmissions, appropriate congestion window growth and delayed
SACKs), which are described in the following subsections.</t>
      <section anchor="splitfastrtx" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Split Fast Retransmissions</name>
        <t>Paths with different latencies lead to overtaking of DATA chunks.
This leads to gap reports, which are handled by Fast Retransmissions.
However, due to the fact that multiple paths are used simultaneously,
these Fast Retransmissions are usually useless and furthermore lead to a
decreased congestion window size.</t>
        <t>To avoid unnecessary Fast Retransmissions, the sender has to keep
track of the path each DATA chunk has been sent on and consider
transmission paths before performing Fast Retransmissions. That is, on
reception of a SACK, the sender MUST identify the highest acknowledged
TSN on each path. A chunk SHOULD only be considered as missing if its
TSN is smaller than the highest acknowledged TSN on its path. Section
3.1 of <xref target="OMNeTWorkshop2010-SCTP" format="default"/> contains an illustrated example.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="cwndupdate" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Appropriate Congestion Window Growth</name>
        <t>The congestion window adaptation algorithm for SCTP <xref target="RFC4960" format="default"/>
allows increasing the congestion window only when a new cumulative ack (CumAck)
is received by a sender. When SACKs with unchanged CumAcks are generated (due to
reordering) and later arrive at a sender, the sender does not modify its
congestion window. Since a CMT-SCTP receiver naturally observes reordering, many
SACKs are sent containing new gap reports but not new CumAcks. When these gaps
are later acked by a new CumAck, congestion window growth occurs, but only for
the data newly acked in the most recent SACK. Data previously acked through gap
reports will not contribute to congestion window growth, in order to prevent
sudden increases in the congestion window resulting in bursts of data being
sent.</t>
        <t>To overcome the problems described above, the congestion window growth has to
be handled as follows <xref target="IAS06" format="default"/>:
</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>The sender SHOULD keep track of the earliest non-retransmitted outstanding
    TSN per path.</li>
          <li>The sender SHOULD keep track of the earliest retransmitted
    outstanding TSN per path.</li>
          <li>The in-order delivery per path SHOULD be deduced.</li>
          <li>The congestion window of a path SHOULD be increased when the earliest
    non-retransmitted outstanding TSN of this path is advanced
    ('Pseudo CumAck') OR when the earliest retransmitted outstanding TSN of this
    path is advanced ('RTX Pseudo CumAck').</li>
        </ul>
        <t>Section 3.2 of <xref target="OMNeTWorkshop2010-SCTP" format="default"/> contains an illustrated
example of appropriate congestion window handling for CMT-SCTP.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="delayedack" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Appropriate Delayed Acknowledgements</name>
        <t>Standard SCTP <xref target="RFC4960" format="default"/> sends a SACK as soon as an
out-of-sequence TSN has been received. Delayed Acknowledgements are only
allowed if the received TSNs are in sequence. However, due to the load
balancing of CMT-SCTP, DATA chunks may overtake each other. This leads
to a high number of out-of-sequence TSNs, which have to be acknowledged
immediately. Clearly, this behaviour increases the overhead traffic
(usually nearly one SACK chunk for each received packet containing a
DATA chunk).</t>
        <t>Delayed Acknowledgements for CMT-SCTP are handled as follows:
</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>In addition to <xref target="RFC4960" format="default"/>, delaying of SACKs SHOULD
   *also* be applied for out-of-sequence TSNs.</li>
          <li>A receiver MUST maintain a counter for the number of DATA chunks
   received before sending a SACK. The value of the counter is stored
   into each SACK chunk (FIXME: add details; needs reservation of flags
   bits by IANA). After transmitting a SACK, the counter MUST be reset
   to 0. Its initial value MUST be 0.</li>
          <li>
            <t>The SACK handling procedure for a missing TSN M is extended as follows:
            </t>
            <ul spacing="normal">
              <li>
                <t>If all newly acknowledged TSNs have been transmitted
         over the same path:
                </t>
                <ul spacing="normal">
                  <li>If there are newly acknowledged TSNs L and H so that L
            &lt;= M &lt;= H, the missing count of TSN M SHOULD
            be incremented by one (like for standard SCTP according to
            <xref target="RFC4960" format="default"/>).</li>
                  <li>Else if all newly acknowledged TSNs N satisfy the
            condition M &lt;= N, the missing count of TSN M SHOULD
            be incremented by the number of TSNs reported in the SACK
            chunk.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Otherwise (that is, there are newly acknowledged TSNs on
         different paths), the missing count of TSN M SHOULD be
         incremented by one (like for standard SCTP according to

        <t>
 Before sending/receiving NR-SACKs (see <xref target="YEN10" format="default"/>), both peer endpoints MUST agree on
using NR-SACKs. This agreement MUST be negotiated during association establishment.
NR-SACK is an extension to the core SCTP, and SCTP extensions that an endpoint
supports are reported to the peer endpoint in Supported Extensions
Parameter during association establishment (see Section 4.2.7 of
<xref target="RFC5061" format="default"/>.)
The Supported Extensions Parameter consists of a list of non-standard Chunk Types
that are supported by the sender.
</t>
        <t>
An endpoint supporting the NR-SACK extension MUST list the NR-SACK
chunk in the Supported Extensions Parameter carried in the INIT
or INIT-ACK chunk, depending on whether the endpoint initiates or
responds to the initiation of the association.
If the NR-SACK chunk type ID is listed in the Chunk Types List of the
Supported Extensions Parameter, then the receiving endpoint MUST assume that
the NR-SACK chunk is supported by the sending endpoint.
</t>
        <t> Both endpoints MUST support NR-SACKs for either endpoint to send an NR-SACK.
If an endpoint establishes an
association with a remote endpoint that does not list NR-SACK in the Supported
Extensions Parameter carried in INIT chunk, then both endpoints of
the association MUST NOT use NR-SACKs.
After association establishment, an endpoint MUST NOT renegotiate the use of NR-SACKs.

<!--ask if we should keep this part-->
<!--
So in such a case remote endpoint receiving the INIT chunk
SHOULD not list NR-SACK in Supported Extensions Parameter
carried in INIT-ACK chunk sent in response to INIT
chunk, even though the remote endpoint is capable of supporting NR-SACK.
-->
</t>
        <t>
Once both endpoints indicate during association establishment
that they support the NR-SACK extension, each endpoint SHOULD
acknowledge received DATA chunks with NR-SACK chunks, and not SACK chunks. <!--ask about SHOULD-->
That is, throughout an SCTP association, both endpoints SHOULD send either
SACK chunks or NR-SACK chunks, never a mixture of the two.

]]></artwork>
        <t>
As the NR-SACK chunk replaces the SACK chunk, many SACK chunk fields
are preserved in the NR-SACK chunk. These preserved fields
have the same semantics with the corresponding SACK chunk fields, as defined in
<xref target="RFC4960" format="default"/>, Section 3.3.4. The Gap Ack fields from RFC4960 have been renamed as R Gap Ack
to emphasize their renegable nature. Their semantics are unchanged.
For completeness, we describe all fields of the NR-SACK chunk,
including those that are identical in the SACK chunk.
</t>
        <t>
Similar to the SACK chunk, the NR-SACK chunk is sent to a peer endpoint to
(1) acknowledge DATA chunks received in-order, (2) acknowledge DATA chunks
received out-of-order, and (3) identify DATA chunks received more than once (i.e., duplicate.)
In addition, the NR-SACK chunk (4) informs
the peer endpoint of non-renegable out-of-order DATA chunks.

<!-- replaced with the above paragraph per Jana's suggestion-->
<!--
   The NR-SACK chunk is sent to the peer endpoint to acknowledge
 DATA chunks received in-order, to acknowledge received
out-of-order DATA chunk blocks, and to inform the peer endpoint of
non-renegable out-of-order DATA chunk blocks.

Because of TSN numbering wraparound, comparisons and all arithmetic
operations discussed in this document are based on

</t>
        <t>   R Gap Ack Blocks are repeated for each R Gap Ack Block up to 'N' defined in
the Number of R Gap Ack Blocks field.  All DATA chunks with TSNs &gt;=

 to have been received correctly, and are renegable.
</t>
        <t>   R Gap Ack Block Start: 16 bits (unsigned integer)
</t>
        <t>    Indicates the Start offset TSN for this R Gap Ack Block.  This number
is set relative to the cumulative TSN number defined in Cumulative TSN Ack field.
To calculate the actual start TSN number, the Cumulative TSN Ack is added to
this offset number.  The calculated TSN identifies the first TSN
in this R Gap Ack Block that has been received.
</t>
        <t>   R Gap Ack Block End:  16 bits (unsigned integer)
</t>
        <t>   Indicates the End offset TSN for this R Gap Ack Block. This number
is set relative to the cumulative TSN number defined in the Cumulative TSN Ack field.
To calculate the actual TSN number, the Cumulative TSN Ack is added to this
offset number.  The calculated TSN identifies the TSN of the last DATA chunk received in this R Gap Ack Block.
</t>
        <t> N(on)R(enegable) Gap Ack Blocks:
</t>
        <t>
The NR-SACK contains zero or more NR Gap Ack Blocks.  Each NR
Gap Ack Block acknowledges a continuous subsequence of non-renegable
out-of-order DATA chunks.
If a TSN is nr-gap-acked in any NR-SACK chunk, then all subsequently transmitted
NR-SACKs with a smaller cum-ack value than that TSN SHOULD also nr-gap-ack that TSN.
</t>
        <t>NR Gap Ack Blocks are repeated for
each NR Gap Ack Block up to 'M' defined in the Number of NR Gap Ack Blocks
field.  All DATA chunks with TSNs &gt;= (Cumulative TSN
Ack + NR Gap Ack Block Start) and &lt;= (Cumulative
TSN Ack + NR Gap Ack Block End) of each NR Gap Ack Block are assumed to be received correctly,
and are Non-Renegable.
</t>
        <t>   NR Gap Ack Block Start: 16 bits (unsigned integer)
</t>
        <t> Indicates the Start offset TSN for this NR Gap Ack Block. This number
is set relative to the cumulative TSN number defined in Cumulative TSN Ack field.
To calculate the actual TSN number, the Cumulative TSN Ack is added to
this offset number. The calculated TSN identifies the first TSN
in this NR Gap Ack Block that has been received.
</t>
        <t>   NR Gap Ack Block End:  16 bits (unsigned integer)
</t>
        <t> Indicates the End offset TSN for this NR Gap Ack Block.
This number is set relative to the cumulative TSN number defined
in Cumulative TSN Ack field. To calculate the actual TSN number, the Cumulative
TSN Ack is added to this offset number. The calculated TSN identifies the
TSN of the last DATA chunk received in this NR Gap Ack Block.
</t>
        <t>Note:</t>
        <t> NR Gap Ack Blocks and R Gap Ack Blocks in an NR-SACK chunk SHOULD acknowledge disjoint sets of
TSNs. That is, an out-of-order TSN SHOULD be listed in either an R Gap Ack Block or an NR Gap Ack Block,
but not the both. R Gap Ack Blocks and NR Gap Ack Blocks together provide the information as do the Gap
Ack Block of a SACK chunk, plus additional information about non-renegability.

</t>
        <t>If all out-of-order data acked by an NR-SACK are renegable, then the Number of NR Gap Ack Blocks MUST be set to 0.
If all out-of-order data acked by an NR-SACK are non-renegable, then the Number of R Gap Ack Blocks SHOULD be set
 to 0. TSNs listed in R Gap Ack Block will be referred as r-gap-acked.
</t>
        <t>   Duplicate TSN: 32 bits (unsigned integer) [Same as SACK chunk]
</t>
        <t>
Indicates a duplicate TSN received since the last NR-SACK was sent.
Exactly 'X' duplicate TSNs SHOULD be reported where 'X' was defined in Number of
Duplicate TSNs field.
</t>
        <t> Each duplicate TSN is listed in this field as many times as
the TSN was received since the previous NR-SACK was sent.
For example, if a data receiver were to get the TSN 19 three times, the data receiver
would list 19 twice in the outbound NR-SACK.  After sending the NR-SACK
if the receiver received one more TSN 19, the receiver would list 19 as a duplicate
once in the next outgoing NR-SACK.

        <t>The above figure shows the list of DATA chunks at the receiver.
TSN denotes the transmission sequence number of the DATA chunk,
SID denotes the stream id to which the DATA chunk belongs,
SSN denotes the sequence number of the DATA chunk within its stream,
and the U bit denotes whether the DATA chunk requires ordered(=0) or unordered(=1)
delivery <xref target="RFC4960" format="default"/>. Note that TSNs 4,9,10, and 12 have not arrived.

not to renege) is Non Renegable(NR), and SHOULD be included in an NR

RFC4960 states that the SCTP endpoint MUST report as many Gap Ack Blocks
as can fit in a single SACK chunk limited by the current path MTU.
When  using NR-SACKs, the SCTP endpoint SHOULD fill as many R Gap Ack Blocks and NR Gap Ack Blocks starting
from the Cumulative TSN Ack value as can fit in a single NR-SACK chunk limited by the current path MTU.
If space remains, the SCTP endpoint SHOULD fill as many Duplicate TSNs as possible starting from

When an NR-SACK chunk is received, all of the NR-SACK fields identical to a

Section 6.2.1 of <xref target="RFC4960" format="default"/>.
</t>

The NR Gap Ack Block Start(s) and NR Gap Ack Block End(s) are
offsets relative to the cum-ack. To calculate the actual range of nr-gap-acked TSNs,
the cum-ack MUST be added to the Start and End.
</t>
          <t>
For example, assume an incoming NR-SACK chunk's cum-ack is
12 and an NR Gap Ack Block defines the NR Gap Ack Block Start=5,
and the NR Gap Ack Block End=7. This NR Gap Ack block nr-gap-acks
TSNs 17 through 19 inclusive.
</t>
          <t>
Upon reception of an NR-SACK chunk, all TSNs listed in either R Gap Ack Block(s) or NR Gap Ack Block(s)
SHOULD be processed as would be TSNs included in Gap Ack Block(s) of a SACK chunk.
All TSNs in all NR Gap Ack Blocks SHOULD be removed from the
data sender's retransmission queue as their delivery to the receiving
application has either already occurred, or is guaranteed
by the data receiver. </t>
          <t>Although R Gap Ack Blocks and NR Gap Ack Blocks SHOULD be disjoint sets,
NR-SACK processing SHOULD work if an NR-SACK chunk has a TSN listed in both an R Gap Ack Block and
an NR Gap Ack Block. In this case, the TSN SHOULD be treated as Non-Renegable.

          <t>
Most of NR-SACK processing at the data sender can be implemented by
using the same routines as in SACK that process the cum ack and the gap ack(s),
followed by removal of nr-gap-acked DATA chunks from the retransmission queue.
However, with NR-SACKs, as out-of-order DATA is sometimes
removed from the retransmission queue, the gap ack processing routine should recognize that
the data sender's retransmission queue has some transmitted data removed.
For example, while calculating missing reports, the
gap ack processing routine cannot assume that the highest TSN transmitted
is always at the tail (right edge) of the retransmission queue.

        <name>Problems during Path Failure</name>
        <t>This section discusses CMT's receive buffer related problems during
path failure, and proposes a solution for the same.</t>
        <section numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Problem Description</name>
          <t> Link failures arise when a router or a link connecting two routers
fails due to link disconnection, hardware malfunction, or software
error. Overloaded links caused by flash crowds and denial-of-service
(DoS) attacks also degrade end-to-end communication between peer hosts.
Ideally, the routing system detects link failures, and in response,
reconfigures the routing tables and avoids routing traffic via the
failed link. However, existing research highlights problems with
Internet backbone routing that result in long route convergence times.
The pervasiveness of path failures motivated us to study their impact on
CMT, since CMT achieves better throughput via simultaneous data
transmission over multiple end-to-end paths.</t>
          <t> CMT is an extension to SCTP, and therefore
retains SCTP's failure detection process. A CMT sender uses a tunable
failure detection threshold called Path.Max.Retrans (PMR). When a sender
experiences more than PMR consecutive timeouts while trying to reach an
active destination, the destination is marked as failed. With PMR=5, the
failure detection takes 6 consecutive timeouts or 63s. After every
timeout, the CMT sender continues to transmit new data on the failed
path increasing the chances of receive buffer (rbuf) blocking and
degrading CMT performance during permanent and short-term path failures
<xref target="NEA08" format="default"/>.</t>
        </section>
        <section numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Solution: Potentially-failed Destination State</name>
          <t>To mitigate the rbuf blocking, we introduce a new destination state
called 'potentially-failed' state in SCTP (and CMT's) failure detection
process <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-sctp-failover" format="default"/>.
This solution is based on the rationale that loss detected by a timeout
implies either severe congestion or failure en route.
After a single timeout on a path, a sender is unsure, and marks the
corresponding destination as 'potentially-failed' (PF).
A PF destination is not used for data transmission or retransmission.
CMT's retransmission policies are augmented to include the PF state.
Performance evaluations prove that the PF state significantly reduces
rbuf blocking during failure detection <xref target="NEA08" format="default"/>.</t>

it affects the send buffer and CMT performance.</t>
        <section numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Problem Description</name>
          <t> Gap-acks acknowledge DATA chunks that arrive out-of-order to a
transport layer data receiver.  A gap-ack in SCTP is advisory, in that,
while it notifies a data sender about the reception of indicated DATA
chunks, the data receiver is permitted to later discard DATA chunks that
it previously had gap-acked.  Discarding a previously gap-acked DATA
chunk is known as 'reneging'.  Because of the possibility of reneging in
SCTP, any gap-acked DATA chunk MUST NOT be removed from the data
sender's retransmission queue until the DATA chunk is later
CumAcked.</t>
          <t>Situations exist when a data receiver knows that reneging on a
particular out-of-order DATA chunk will never take place, such as (but
not limited to) after an out-of-order DATA chunk is delivered to the
receiving application. With current SACKs in SCTP, it is not possible
for a data receiver to inform a data sender if or when a particular
out-of-order 'deliverable' DATA chunk has been 'delivered' to the
receiving application.  Thus the data sender MUST keep a copy of every
gap-acked out-of-order DATA chunk(s) in the data sender's retransmission
queue until the DATA chunk is CumAcked.  This use of the data sender's
retransmission queue is wasteful. The wasted buffer often degrades CMT
performance; the degradation increases when a CMT flow traverses via
paths with disparate end-to-end properties <xref target="NEY08" format="default"/>.</t>

          <name>Solution: Non-Renegable SACKs</name>
          <t>Non-Renegable Selective Acknowledgments (NR-SACKs)
<xref target="nrsack" format="default"/> are a new kind of
acknowledgements, extending SCTP's SACK chunk functionalities. The
NR-SACK chunk is an extension of the existing SACK chunk. Several fields
are identical, including the Cumulative TSN Ack, the Advertised Receiver
Window Credit (a_rwnd), and Duplicate TSNs. These fields have the same
semantics as described in <xref target="RFC4960" format="default"/>.</t>
          <t>NR-SACKs also identify out-of-order DATA chunks that a receiver either:
(1) has delivered to its receiving application, or
(2) takes full responsibility to eventually deliver to its receiving application.
These out-of-order DATA chunks are 'non-renegable.'
Non-Renegable data are reported in the NR Gap Ack Block field of the
NR-SACK chunk as described <xref target="nrsack" format="default"/>.
We refer to non-renegable selective acknowledgements as 'nr-gap-acks.'</t>
          <t> When an out-of-order DATA chunk is nr-gap-acked, the data sender no
longer needs to keep that particular DATA chunk in its retransmission
queue, thus allowing the data sender to free up its buffer space sooner
than if the DATA chunk were only gap-acked.  NR-SACKs improve send
buffer utilization and throughput for CMT flows

        <t>CMT-SCTP assumes all paths to be disjoint. Since each path
independently uses a TCP-like congestion control, an SCTP association

            <abstract>
              <t>The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) supports multihoming. However, when the failover operation specified in RFC 4960 is followed, there can be significant delay and performance degradation in the data transfer path failover. This document specifies a quick failover algorithm and introduces the SCTP Potentially Failed (SCTP-PF) destination state in SCTP Path Management.

 This document also specifies a dormant state operation of SCTP that is required to be followed by an SCTP-PF implementation, but it may equally well be applied by a standard SCTP implementation, as described in RFC 4960.

 Additionally, this document introduces an alternative switchback operation mode called "Primary Path Switchover" that will be beneficial in certain situations. This mode of operation applies to both a standard SCTP implementation and an SCTP-PF implementation.

 The procedures defined in the document require only minimal modifications to the specification in RFC 4960. The procedures are sender-side only and do not impact the SCTP receiver.
